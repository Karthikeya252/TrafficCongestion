This project is just a demostration of traffic Congestion(full of vehicles).
In this project I have used few libraries of python like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn for clustring the data.
I fed three datasets that are weather data, accident data and traffic data in CSV(Comma Separated Values).
This project only deals with the data analysis of how much traffic congestion is happening.
